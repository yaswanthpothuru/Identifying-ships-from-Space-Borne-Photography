* This is a capstone project done as part Udacity Nano degree Program 
* I have used python notebook application for this project.
* This project is about detecting vessels or ships in a given satellite image
* The libraries which I used include: 
1. Numpy, pandas, matplotlib for data visualization
2. Model selection, metrics for the data processing
